Paste a text into input.txt to analyze vocabulary, save and close the file.

The text vocabulary will be placed into output-new.txt, so the file's content will be replaced. 

The base.txt will be updated - new vocabulary will be added to the existent vocabulary list. 

Make sure you save base.txt elsewhere or clean the file if you don't want to mix the vocabulary lists.

Click the ANALYZE button to start.


In case you want to merge two bases - save one base.txt file as ouput-new.txt in the program directory,

place the other base.txt into the program directory. Try not to edit base.txt or problems may come.

You can make your own list of unknown words. To do so place a list of the words you know to known_words.txt

each word on a new line.

All .txt files used in this program should be encoded with UTF8.


Output data comes in the next format: [number,word] and you can copy it to Excel for further usage.

Excel makes able to copy only words, place them into Google translate that returns the translated list.

An app with space repetiotion system, such as AnkDroid makes easier to learn the vocabulary you 

get from Vocabulary Builder.
